name: Publish Test Results

# Takes the artifacts uploaded by run-unit-tests and publishes them in PRs as a comment.
# This is needed in order to support PRs created from forks, as PRs from Forks or Dependabot
# run in read-only mode and can't comment on PRs, for example.
# More context here: https://github.blog/changelog/2021-02-19-github-actions-workflows-triggered-by-dependabot-prs-will-run-with-read-only-permissions/
# This work-around makes it so that:
#   - this workflow is triggered by the end of the test workflow, instead
#     of being triggered directly by the PR
#   - we can control the permissions to only have what's needed to write comments, etc.
