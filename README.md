If you compile the open source software that we make available from time to time to develop your own mobile, desktop or web application, and cause that application to connect to our servers for any purposes, we refer to that resulting application as an “Open Source App”.  All Open Source Apps are subject to, and may only be used and/or commercialized in accordance with, the Terms of Use applicable to the Wire Application, which can be found at https://wire.com/legal/#terms.  Additionally, if you choose to build an Open Source App, certain restrictions apply, as follows:

For clarity, if you compile the open source software that we make available from time to time to develop your own mobile, desktop or web application, and do not cause that application to connect to our servers for any purposes, then that application will not be deemed an Open Source App and the foregoing will not apply to that application.

# Wire Android

## What is included in the open source client

The project in this repository contains the Wire for Android client project. You can build the project yourself. However, there are some differences with the binary Wire client available on the Play Store.
These differences are:

- the open source project does not include the API keys of 3rd party services.
- the open source project links against the open source Wire audio-video-signaling (AVS) library. The binary Play Store client links against an AVS version that contains proprietary improvements for the call quality.

## Required software

In order to build Wire for Android locally, it is necessary to have the following tools installed:

- JDK 17
- Android SDK
- Android NDK

## Gradle

These are the available `gradle` tasks via command line:

 - ```./gradlew compileApp```: Compiles the Wire Android Client
 - ```./gradlew assembleApp```: Assembles the Wire Android Client
 - ```./gradlew runApp```: Assembles and runs the Wire Android Client in the connected device.
 - ```./gradlew runUnitTests```: Runs all Unit Tests.
 - ```./gradlew runAcceptanceTests```: Runs all Acceptance Tests in the connected device.
 - ```./gradlew testCoverage```: Generates a report for test code coverage 
 - ```./gradlew staticCodeAnalysis```: Runs static code analysis on the Wire Android codebase


## Android Studio

Import the project as a gradle project by browsing to the root path of the ```build.gradle.kts``` file of your project's directory.


## Typical build issues

It might be that after cloning the Android project, some build issues appear on your IDE (IntelliJ or Android studio). To avoid most of these, make sure that:
- After cloning the Android project, you have run `git submodule update --init --recursive` (to init any needed configuration within the embedded Kalium submodule project)
- There is a valid SDK path on your `local.properties` AND `kalium/local.properties` files pointing to the Android SDK folder. In Mac, that folder can be usually found under `sdk.dir=/Users/YOUR_USER_FOLDER/Library/Android/sdk`. The IDE **will not** create `kalium/local.properties` automatically, so you might want to copy/paste the one in the project root
- When you've already started working on the project adding some commits, it might occur that your local build breaks, if that is the case, make sure you've updated the `kalium` submodule reference by running: `git submodule update --remote --merge`

# App flavours

We have a few different app flavours with different intended usages. Each app flavour has a different icon background colour to enable easier distinction.
To see how they are customised in details, check [the flavour configuration file](./default.json).

> [!NOTE]  
> For custom builds, we overwrite some of the flags, strings, and icons. Check the [CUSTOMIZATION.md](./CUSTOMIZATION.md) for details.

| Name     | Icon background colour | Description / Intended Usage                                                                                                                                                                      | Logging Enabled | Default Backend |
|----------|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Dev      | 🔴                     | For developing new features. Bleeding edge. Unstable. Staging Backend. Eats experimental features for breakfast and drinks developers tears as dessert.                                           | ✅               | Wire Staging    |
| Staging  | 🟡                     | Mainly for QA to test a release-like app with a staging backend. Imitates the Production/Release application, having features flags following the Prod/White app below, but with extra dev tools. | ✅               | Wire Staging    |
| Internal | 🟢                     | Currently unused (?). It was used in the past and _probably_ should be deleted any time soon.                                                                                                     | ✅               | Wire Prod       |
| Beta     | 🔵                     | Used by internal users within the company as dogfood. Some features that are not yet ready for the general public might be tested here first.                                                     | ✅               | Wire Prod       |
| Prod     | ⚪                      | The production app available to the general public.                                                                                                                                               | ✖️              | Wire Prod       |
| F-Droid  | ⚪                      | Also a production app available to the general public. Published on the F-Droid store, but without any closed-source software.                                                                    | ✖️              | Wire Prod       |

## Logging
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Logs on all builds except Prod and F-Droid will be uploaded to a third party service for developer analysis.
> 
> Logs on Prod and F-Droid can be enabled within the application, but they are **NOT** uploaded anywhere. Users can export and read the log files manually from the application.
> 
> We do not log sensitive content (such as content of messages, encryption keys, etc.) in any way whatsoever. And things like unique identifiers are obfuscated.

## Build Types

The apps can be built for release or debugging. Debug versions might have extra debugging tools, are not minified, and can be profiled if needed. In general, debug builds _run slower_ due to the lack of minimisation.
