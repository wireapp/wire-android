/**
 * Creates a time-based, auto-incrementing Integer build version.
 * It takes into consideration the epoch seconds, incrementing the build by one every ten seconds.
 * In order to maximize the range, an offset was added. So instead of starting the count on 1970-01-01, it starts on 2021-04-21.
 * This has been built to match the current Groovy implementation:
 * https://github.com/wireapp/wire-android/blob/594497477325d77c1d203dbcaab79fb14b511530/app/build.gradle#L467
